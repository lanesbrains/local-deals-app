# ðŸ“§ Resend Email Service Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide will help you set up Resend for sending newsletters and transactional emails in your PNW Deals app.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup

### Step 1: Create Resend Account

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Get API Key

1. In Resend dashboard, go to "API Keys"
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Name it "PNW Deals Production"
4. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)
5. Add to your `.env` file:
   ```env
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

### Step 3: Add Your Domain (Optional but Recommended)

1. In Resend dashboard, go to "Domains"
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `pnwdeals.com`)
4. Add the DNS records they provide
5. Wait for verification (usually 5-10 minutes)

### Step 4: Update Email Addresses

Once your domain is verified, update the "from" address in your newsletter script:

```javascript
// In scripts/send-newsletter.js, change this line:
from: "PNW Deals <deals@pnwdeals.local>",
// To your actual domain:
from: "PNW Deals <deals@yourdomain.com>",
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Email Delivery

### Test Newsletter Script

```bash

```

### Test Individual Email

Create a test script to verify Resend is working:

```javascript
// test-email.js
import { Resend } from "resend";

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

async function testEmail() {
  try {
    const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
      from: "PNW Deals <deals@yourdomain.com>",
      to: ["your-email@example.com"],
      subject: "Test Email from PNW Deals",
      html: "<h1>Hello from PNW Deals!</h1><p>If you receive this, Resend is working correctly.</p>",
    });

    if (error) {
      console.error("Error:", error);
    } else {
      console.log("Success:", data);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
}

testEmail();
```

## ðŸ”§ Newsletter Flow Verification

### Current Flow:

1. **User Signs Up** â†’ Creates user record with category preferences
2. **Business Creates Deal** â†’ Deal stored in database with business_id
3. **Weekly Newsletter Runs** â†’ Filters deals by user preferences and sends via Resend
4. **Stripe Webhook** â†’ Updates subscription status when payment succeeds

### Verification Checklist:

- [ ] Resend API key is configured
- [ ] Newsletter script runs without errors
- [ ] Deals are being created by businesses
- [ ] Users receive emails with relevant deals only
- [ ] Unsubscribe links work
- [ ] Email formatting looks good on mobile

## ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring & Analytics

### Resend Dashboard Metrics:

- **Delivery Rate**: Should be >95%
- **Open Rate**: Aim for >20% (industry average)
- **Click Rate**: Aim for >2%
- **Bounce Rate**: Should be <5%

### Email Best Practices:

1. **Subject Lines**: Keep under 50 characters
2. **From Name**: Use consistent "PNW Deals" branding
3. **Content**: Mobile-first design, clear CTAs
4. **Frequency**: Weekly is perfect (not too spammy)
5. **Personalization**: Filter by user preferences (already implemented)

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. "API key not found" error**

- Check `.env` file has correct `RESEND_API_KEY`
- Restart your development server after adding the key

**2. "Domain not verified" error**

- Use `@resend.dev` domain for testing
- Or verify your custom domain in Resend dashboard

**3. Emails going to spam**

- Add SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records (Resend provides these)
- Use a consistent "from" address
- Avoid spam trigger words in subject lines

**4. Newsletter not sending**

- Check if there are active subscribers in database
- Verify deals exist from the past 7 days
- Check console logs for errors

### Debug Commands:

```bash
# Check database for subscribers
npm run check-db

# Test newsletter with verbose logging
DEBUG=true node scripts/send-newsletter.js

# Test Resend API connection
node test-email.js
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Production Deployment

### Environment Variables for Production:

```env
# Production Resend setup
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_production_api_key
APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# Update newsletter "from" address
# In scripts/send-newsletter.js:
from: "PNW Deals <deals@yourdomain.com>"
```

### Netlify Scheduled Function:

Your `netlify.toml` already has the scheduled function configured:

```toml
[[scheduled]]
  function = "send-deal-notifications"
  cron = "0 9 * * 1"  # Every Monday at 9 AM UTC
```

This will automatically run your newsletter every week!
